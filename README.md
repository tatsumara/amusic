This is the Altair music bot! I decided to make music functionality a separate bot altogether, as this is quite a massive undertaking.

## Usage example
Requires ``ffmpeg`` to be installed on your system, unless you're using the docker image.
This bot is not at all functional currently! I have *not* implement *any* functionality, this currently just serves as a placeholder.
## TODO
* Get basic play functionality to work
* Implement queue system
* And everything else, basically
## Issues
* None.
